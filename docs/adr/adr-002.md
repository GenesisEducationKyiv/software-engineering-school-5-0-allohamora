# ADR-002: Choosing a Scheduling Approach for Weather Updates

**Date:** 2025-06-08

**Status:** Accepted

**Author:** Herman Hrand

## Context

The application needs to send weather updates to subscribed users on a regular basis. These updates are delivered on fixed schedules (hourly/daily) based on user preferences. We need to determine the most appropriate approach for scheduling and managing these recurring tasks.

**Requirements:**

- Weather updates must be sent at fixed intervals (hourly or daily)
- We shouldn't retry failed delivery attempts as this could confuse users with inconsistent timing
- The scheduling mechanism should be reliable and maintainable
- The solution should align with the overall complexity requirements of the project

## Choices

1. **Cron-Based Job Scheduler (Croner)**

   - **Pros:**
     - Simple implementation for fixed-interval tasks
     - Perfect fit for sending updates at regular, predictable times
     - Lightweight in-memory solution without external dependencies
     - Easy to maintain and understand
     - Predictable behavior aligns with user expectations
   - **Cons:**
     - Limited retry capabilities for failed operations
     - Potential for missed updates if the server is down during scheduled time
     - Less scalable for distributed environments
     - No built-in monitoring or insights into task performance

2. **Message Queue System (e.g., BullMQ)**

   - **Pros:**
     - Robust retry mechanisms for handling failures
     - Better scalability across multiple servers
     - Built-in monitoring and insights
     - More flexibility for complex scheduling requirements
     - Better handling of high-volume workloads
   - **Cons:**
     - Introduces additional complexity to the system
     - Requires additional infrastructure (Redis) to function
     - Retries could lead to inconsistent timing of weather updates
     - Overkill for simple, predictable scheduling needs

## Decision

We will implement a cron-based scheduling approach using the Croner library for managing weather update tasks. This solution aligns with our requirements for simplicity, reliability, and appropriate complexity levels.

## Consequences

**Positive:**

- Simplified Timing: Weather updates are sent at fixed intervals (hourly/daily) or not at all
- Meets User Expectations: No retries means updates arrive only at expected times, avoiding confusion
- Reduced Complexity: In-memory scheduling is simpler to implement and maintain
- Faster development time and easier maintenance
- No additional infrastructure dependencies

**Negative:**

- No built-in retry mechanism for failed deliveries (though this aligns with our requirements)
- Less scalable if the application needs to distribute across multiple servers
- Potential for missed updates during server downtime
- Limited monitoring capabilities compared to message queue systems
