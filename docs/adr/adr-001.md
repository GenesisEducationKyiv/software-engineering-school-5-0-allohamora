# ADR-001: Choosing a Method for Handling Subscription Creation

**Date:** 2025-06-07

**Status:** Accepted

**Author:** Herman Hrand

## Context

**Subscription Flow:**

- User sends a request to subscribe to weather updates
- User receives a confirmation message with an activation link
- User confirms the subscription by clicking the activation link
- User receives regular weather updates after confirmation

**Requirements:**

- Users must be able to repeat subscription requests to mitigate cases where they don't receive the confirmation message
- Subscriptions cannot be activated after 30 minutes of inactivity to ensure only engaged users complete the process

## Choices

1. **Store Subscription Token and State in Database**

   - **Pros:**
     - Ability to query and track all unconfirmed subscriptions
     - Short confirmation links for better user experience
   - **Cons:**
     - Adds complexity to database schema and application logic to enable repeated requests
     - Necessitates storage of subscription state to enforce the 30-minute inactivity limit
     - Requires database access for each subscription request, increasing latency
     - Creates need for periodic cleanup of expired unconfirmed subscriptions

2. **Use JWT with Embedded Subscription Data**

   - **Pros:**
     - Eliminates need to store unconfirmed subscriptions in the database
     - No requirement for database-stored subscription state
     - Reduces database access for subscription processing
     - Can leverage JWT expiration (TTL) to enforce the 30-minute inactivity limit
     - Simplifies repeated subscription requests without additional logic
   - **Cons:**
     - Unable to query or report on unconfirmed subscriptions
     - Longer confirmation links due to JWT payload inclusion
     - Increased token size if subscription data grows substantially

## Decision

We will implement the JWT-based approach as it provides a simpler and more efficient solution for our use case. This method allows us to handle subscription requests without the overhead of managing unconfirmed subscriptions in the database, while still enforcing the 30-minute inactivity limit through JWT expiration.

## Consequences

**Positive:**

- Eliminates the need to store unconfirmed subscriptions in the database
- Reduces database access, leading to improved response times and system performance
- Simplifies system architecture by removing the need for subscription state management
- Automatically handles expired unconfirmed subscriptions through JWT expiration
- Enables seamless handling of repeated subscription requests without additional logic

**Negative:**

- No ability to track, monitor, or report on unconfirmed subscriptions
- Longer confirmation links due to JWT payload inclusion, potentially affecting email readability
- Increased token size if subscription data grows substantially
